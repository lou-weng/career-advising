## Applications
Job searching for software roles often require these three components
1. resume + projects to get past initial screening stages
2. technical know-how to demonstrate your skills

### Supplementing your application
Just a resume is not enough when you are starting out your job search. Make sure you have proof of any work or projects you've done! The following are some examples of supplementary activities/resources that could be useful

**Certifications**: Azure, AWS, Cloud certifications demonstrate knowledge of material

**Personal Projects**: have a personal github account with repos of coding projects you've created

**Open Source Contributions**: be active in open source communities and see if there are ways you can contribute meaningful code to existing or new open source projects

**Hackathons**: great source to get hands on experience of new technologies and actually create something tangible. 
* :star: there is one hackathon out there each week, use this [link](https://mlh.io/seasons/2022/events) to start looking for some

### Practicing your coding skills
Use the following resources to aid you in passing technical interviews.  
:exclamation: don't overthink the language you use. Use what you are most comfortable with (Java, C++, C#, Python, Javascript). I personally use python because it's less verbose than Java or C++

[**Leetcode**](https://leetcode.com): most popular platform to test your skills and do algorithms/data structure questions

[**Hackerrank**](https://www.hackerrank.com): similar to Leetcode

[**CodeWars**](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard): similar to Leetcode, more gamified

[**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com): more oriented for machine learning and data science

### Topics you are expected to know
* how to use version control software (Git, Github, BitBucket)
* how to use command line/terminal
* object oriented principles/programming
* understanding of algorithms (sorting, searching, traversals)
* understanding of data structures ( arrays, trees, graphs, heaps)

### Topics you really should know (depending on your role)
* using cloud platforms like AWS and Azure
* using UNIX/linux systems
* SQL
* bash/powershell scripting
* agile methodology
* technical writing
* design patterns

## FAQ

How many resumes do I need to send out before I get a job?
> No idea, but let's just say 50 every two weeks as a rough benchmark

Do I need cover letters?
> Depends. 
> For larger firms (Big N, SAP) where there are a high volume of applicants, cover letters probably won't get read  
> For smaller firms, make sure you tailor your cover letter to the job (generic cover letters actually reflect worse on you)

How important are referrals?
> Referrals can help boost your chances of making it past the resume stage of the application process. However, once you are in the interview stage of the process, it is all up to you to make sure you do coding practice and are prepared.
